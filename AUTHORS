FLINT has been developed since 2007 by a large numnber of people. Initially
the library was started by David Harvey and William Hart. Later maintenance
of the library was taken over solely by William Hart.

The main authors of FLINT to date have been William Hart, David Harvey (no
longer active), Fredrik Johansson, Sebastian Pancratz and Andy Novocin.

Other significant contributions to FLINT have been made by:

Jason Papadopoulos : Block Lanczos code and multiprecision complex root finding
Gonzalo Tornaria : Theta function module, Montgomery multiplication and modular
                   multiplication code in Z[x]
David Howden : Computing Bernoulli numbers mod many primes, fast polynomial
               multiplication over Z/pZ
Burcin Erocal : Primary FLINT wrapper in Sage
Tom Boothby : Improved factoring of unsigned longs and detection of perfect 
              powers
Daniel Woodhouse : Multivariate multiplication over Z/nZ, Z and 
                   getPeriodSequence 
Tomasz Lechowski : NTL and Pari profiling code
Richard Howell-Peak : Polynomial factorisation and irreducibility testing for
                      polys over Z/pZ
Peter Shrimpton : Basic prime sieve, Pocklingtom-Lehmer, Lucas, BPSW and n-1
                  primality tests and a Weiferich prime search program
Andres Goens: Fq module and polynomials over Fq
Lina Kulakova: Factorisation for polynomials over F_p for large p.
Thomas DuBuisson: Logical ops for fmpz module, patches to the build system.
Jean-Pierre Flori: Many build system patches and Sage integration.
Frithjof Schulze: Some fmpz functions and various patches.
Curtis Bright: Numerous patches including 32 bit support
Jan Tuitman : contributed to the design of the padics module.

Additional research was contributed by Daniel Scott and Daniel Ellam.

Further patches and bug reports have been made by Michael Abshoff, Didier 
Deshommes, Craig Citro, Timothy Abbot, Carl Witty, Jaap Spies, Kiran 
Kedlaya, William Stein, Kate Minola, Robert Bradshaw, Serge Torres, Dan 
Grayson, Martin Lee, Bob Smith, Antony Vennard, Frederic Chyzak, Julien
Puydt and many others.

Ralph Hemmecke made available an autotools build for FLINT.

Numerous people have contributed to wrapping FLINT in Sage and debugging, 
including Mike Hansen, Jean-Pierre Flori, Burcin Erocal, Robert Bradshaw,
Martin Albrecht, Sebastian Pancratz, Fredrik Johansson,

Some code (longlong.h and clz_tab.c) has been used from the GMP library, 
whose main author is Torbjorn Granlund.

FLINT 2 was a complete rewrite from scratch which began in about 2010.

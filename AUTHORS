FLINT has been developed since 2007 by a large numnber of people. Initially
the library was started by David Harvey and William Hart. Later maintenance
of the library was taken over solely by William Hart.

The main authors of FLINT to date have been William Hart, David Harvey (no
longer active), Fredrik Johansson, Sebastian Pancratz and Andy Novocin.

Other significant contributions to FLINT have been made by:

Jason Papadopoulos : Block Lanczos code and multiprecision complex root finding
Gonzalo Tornaria : Theta function module, Montgomery multiplication and modular
                   multiplication code in Z[x]
David Howden : Computing Bernoulli numbers mod many primes, fast polynomial
               multiplication over Z/pZ
Burcin Erocal : Primary FLINT wrapper in Sage
Tom Boothby : Improved factoring of unsigned longs and detection of perfect 
              powers
Daniel Woodhouse : Multivariate multiplication over Z/nZ, Z and 
                   getPeriodSequence 
Tomasz Lechowski : NTL and Pari profiling code
Richard Howell-Peak : Polynomial factorisation and irreducibility testing for
                      polys over Z/pZ
Peter Shrimpton : Basic prime sieve, Pocklingtom-Lehmer, Lucas, BPSW and n-1
                  primality tests and a Weiferich prime search program

Jan Tuitman : contributed to the design of the padics module.

Additional research was contributed by Daniel Scott and Daniel Ellam.

Further patches and bug reports have been made by Michael Abshoff, Didier 
Deshommes, Craig Citro, Timothy Abbot, Carl Witty, Jaap Spies, Kiran 
Kedlaya, William Stein, Robert Bradshaw, Serge Torres and many others.

Some code (longlong.h and clz_tab.c) has been used from the GMP library, 
whose main author is Torbjorn Granlund.

FLINT 2 was a complete rewrite from scratch which began in about 2010.
